This is my personal game project.
I started this in June of 2022 because I wanted to make something for my portfolio over the summer.

This is a simple 2D platformer / metroidvania created in Unity. It is my first project I have ever created in 2D. 
Although there is a vision to this game it is also sort of a playground for me to learn and create new things in Unity for a game.

Right now it is very much a WIP, but eventually I would like to publish it as a full fledged game I think.
