Bugs:
    - While in air, player can cling to walls
        - Could be a feature, but needs proper animations
    - Enemies can be killed right as they spawn, only destroying the collider, not the whole enemy, essentially softlocking the game.
    - Boss can clip through floor (from spawning slime) causing it to be unkillable.

    - New player animations
        - Combo swing (WIP)
    - Bat sprite update (with animation)
