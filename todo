Refactoring:
    - **Big Project** Probably should go through both player and enemies' scripts and make them cleaner (headers, comments, code layout, etc) enemies should probably inherit from an abstract class
        Scripts are starting to turn to spaghetti and need to be maintained sooner rather than later.
    - Buff inventory can maybe be a regular inventory? Items already have a buff tag which can be used to distinguish between items to call buff updates on.
    - Should proably make a class for all the buff stuff, just to keep it better organized. Static procedures (is that the right word? Functions should just be nearly identical across implemenations).
    - Enemy abstract class could also make use of the IDamageable, IKnockbackable, and IBuffable (need to reimplement) classes in their definitions.
    - Players and enemies should get their stats from a separate script / file. Items and other things can update this file, and then call an update method on the enemy/player to update their stats.
    - Player probably doesn't need the item pick up collider anymore

Bugs:
    - While in air, player can cling to walls
        - Could be a feature, but needs proper animations
    - Enemies can be killed right as they spawn, only destroying the collider, not the whole enemy, essentially softlocking the game.
    - Boss can clip through floor (from spawning slime) causing it to be unkillable.

Sprites & Animation
    - New player animations
        - Combo swing (WIP)
    - Bat sprite update (with animation)
    - New Enemies
    - Anvil
        - Upgrade animation?
    - Portal
        - Most likely an animation
    - Death animations
        - For both the player and enemies
